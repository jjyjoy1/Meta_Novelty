Suppose goals are ambitious and highly relevant for modern **proteomics-based biomarker discovery and functional profiling**. 
Here's a structured plan and suggestions using **ML/DL** to achieve both objectives:

---

## ðŸ§  Goal 1: Discover Protein Patterns Across Samples & Metadata

### ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

1. Identify **co-expression clusters** or **modules** of proteins.
2. Link these modules to **metadata covariates** (e.g., disease state, tissue type).
3. Use **unsupervised + supervised ML** to discover patterns and predictive features.

### ðŸ”§ Tools/Methods:

* **Dimensionality Reduction**:

  * PCA, t-SNE, UMAP: visualize high-dimensional protein patterns.
  * Autoencoders (DL): learn latent features representing protein structure patterns.
* **Clustering**:

  * K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN on protein expression matrix.
  * WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) adapted for proteomics.
* **Supervised Learning**:

  * Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Nets to predict metadata (e.g., disease status).
  * Feature importance reveals key proteins linked to metadata.
* **Interpretability**:

  * SHAP, LIME for understanding model-driven feature-protein relationships.

## ðŸ§¬ Goal 2: Discover Novel Proteins via ML/DL

### ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

1. Predict the presence of proteins **not detected directly** (low abundance/rare).
2. Identify **novel combinations** or **latent signals** suggesting new proteins.

### ðŸ”§ Techniques:

* **Matrix Completion / Imputation**:

  * Use matrix factorization, KNN, or DL (e.g., autoencoders) to infer missing proteins.
* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**:

  * Encode proteins as nodes, connect via co-expression or known interactions.
  * Predict missing nodes (proteins) or edges (relationships).
* **Generative Models**:

  * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), GANs on abundance profiles to simulate latent proteins.
* **Outlier Ensemble Learning**:

  * Train on "known" patterns, flag rare/unusual as potential novel proteins.

### ðŸ§ª Suggested Pipeline Expansion


```python
rule run_protein_ml_analysis:
    input:
        abundance=f"{NORMAL_DIR}/normalized_filtered.csv",
        metadata="metadata/metadata.csv"
    output:
        clusters=f"{RESULTS_DIR}/protein_clusters.csv",
        models=f"{RESULTS_DIR}/ml_model.pkl",
        novel=f"{RESULTS_DIR}/novel_proteins.csv"
    script:
        "scripts/protein_pattern_ml.py"


rule analyze_novel_proteins:
    input:
        abundance=f"{NORMAL_DIR}/normalized_filtered.csv"
    output:
        novel=f"{RESULTS_DIR}/novel_proteins.csv"
    script:
        "scripts/protein_novel_prediction.py"


```

And then in `protein_pattern_ml.py`, perform clustering, supervised learning, and matrix completion to predict novel proteins.
