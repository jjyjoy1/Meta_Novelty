Let's explore publicly available datasets for both proteomics and metabolomics analyses, along with command-line tools to process them.
This will help us understand the data processing workflows and the types of outputs and targets we can expect.

## 🧪 Proteomics Dataset and Processing

### 🔹 Dataset: PRIDE Project PXD052579

* **Description**: Serum LC-MS/MS data from patients with ischemic stroke.
* **Access**: Available through the PRIDE Archive at [ProteomeCentral](https://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/).
* **Data Files**: Raw mass spectrometry files in `.raw` format.

### 🔹 Processing Workflow Using MaxQuant (Command-Line)

1. **Install MaxQuant**:

   * Download MaxQuant from the [official website](https://www.maxquant.org/).
   * Ensure you have Mono installed if running on Linux.

2. **Prepare Input Files**:

   * Place `.raw` files in a designated folder.
   * Create a `mqpar.xml` file specifying parameters like enzyme specificity, fixed and variable modifications, and the FASTA database for protein identification.

3. **Run MaxQuant**:

   ```bash
   mono MaxQuantCmd.exe mqpar.xml
   ```

   * This command processes the raw files based on the parameters set in `mqpar.xml`.

### 🔹 Expected Outputs

* **ProteinGroups.txt**: Quantitative data of identified proteins across samples.
* **Peptides.txt**: Information on identified peptides.
* **Evidence.txt**: Detailed evidence for peptide-spectrum matches.
* **Summary.txt**: Overview of the processing run.

### 🔹 Targets Detected

* **Protein Identification**: Determine the proteins present in the serum samples.
* **Quantitative Analysis**: Compare protein abundance between ischemic stroke patients and controls.
* **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify proteins that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in disease conditions.

## ⚗️ Metabolomics Dataset and Processing

### 🔹 Dataset: Metabolomics Workbench Study ST002964

* **Description**: Comprehensive untargeted LC-MS metabolomics analysis.
* **Access**: Available at [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCStudySummary.php).
* **Data Files**: Raw LC-MS data in formats like `.mzML` or `.cdf`.

### 🔹 Processing Workflow Using XCMS (R Package)

1. **Install XCMS**:

   ```R
   install.packages("BiocManager")
   BiocManager::install("xcms")
   ```

2. **Load Libraries**:

   ```R
   library(xcms)
   ```

3. **Import Data**:

   ```R
   files <- list.files(path = "path_to_data", pattern = ".mzML", full.names = TRUE)
   raw_data <- readMSData(files, mode = "onDisk")
   ```

4. **Peak Detection**:

   ```R
   cwp <- CentWaveParam()
   xdata <- findChromPeaks(raw_data, param = cwp)
   ```

5. **Retention Time Correction**:

   ```R
   xdata <- adjustRtime(xdata)
   ```

6. **Peak Grouping**:

   ```R
   xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata)
   ```

7. **Fill Missing Peaks**:

   ```R
   xdata <- fillChromPeaks(xdata)
   ```

8. **Export Feature Table**:

   ```R
   feature_table <- featureValues(xdata)
   write.csv(feature_table, "metabolomics_feature_table.csv")
   ```

### 🔹 Expected Outputs

* **Feature Table**: Matrix of detected metabolite features (m/z, retention time) across samples.
* **Chromatograms**: Visual representation of metabolite peaks.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Data ready for downstream statistical analysis like PCA or differential analysis.

### 🔹 Targets Detected

* **Metabolite Profiling**: Identify and quantify metabolites present in the samples.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Determine metabolites that differ significantly between experimental groups.
* **Pathway Analysis**: Map altered metabolites to metabolic pathways to understand biological implications.
