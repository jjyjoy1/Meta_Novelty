Below is a roadmap we can adapt or scale-down for a given study; 
I’ve split it into **(1) a testable hypothesis space** and **(2) a step-by-step integrative workflow** with concrete novelty-detection checkpoints.

---

## 1.  Hypothesis Space ― what “novelty” could mean

| Level                  | Example falsifiable hypothesis                                                                                                                       | “Novel” signal you’ll try to capture                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Genome / taxon**     | *Some MAGs recovered from the deep subsurface aquifer have < 95 % ANI to any GTDB genome and encode distinct carbohydrate-active enzyme repertoires* | Low-ANI MAGs; atypical phylogenetic placement—e.g., new family in GTDB classification |
| **Protein sequence**   | *Samples contain actively expressed glycoside-hydrolase peptides whose sequences show < 30 % identity to CAZy entries*                               | Peptides/ORFs with poor BLAST/HMMER hits; high structural novelty by ESMFold          |
| **Function / pathway** | *These novel enzymes enable degradation of lignin-like aromatics absent from reference pathways*                                                     | MetaCyc / KEGG-ortholog gaps; enrichment of novel catalytic motifs                    |
| **Ecological role**    | *Novel proteins are highly abundant under in-situ temperatures, indicating thermoadaptive innovation*                                                | Spectral intensities correlate with temperature or geochemistry metadata              |

Pick one primary hypothesis and treat the others as secondary outcomes so your statistical power isn’t diluted.

## 2.  Analysis Road-Map (metagenome ➝ metaproteome ➝ novelty scores)

### A. Sampling & wet-lab preliminaries

1. **Replicated study design** – at least *n ≥ 3* biological replicates per condition.
2. **Shotgun metagenomics** (Illumina + ≥ 100 Gbp per sample, or PacBio HiFi/ONT for long reads).
3. **Metaproteomics** – LC-MS/MS with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) *plus* at least one DIA run for deeper coverage.

### B. Metagenome bioinformatics

| Step                                | Recommended toolchain                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QC & host read removal              | *fastp*, *BMTagger*                                                                 |
| Assembly                            | *MEGAHIT* (short-reads) + *Flye*/*Hifiasm* (long-reads)                             |
| Binning                             | *VAMB* → dereplication with *dRep*                                                  |
| MAG quality                         | *CheckM2*; retain ≥ 90 % completeness, ≤ 5 % contamination                          |
| Taxonomic placement & novelty score | *GTDB-Tk* → calculate ANI vs GTDB; < 95 % ANI → candidate novel species ([MDPI][1]) |
| ORF prediction                      | *Prodigal* (meta mode) on MAGs + unbinned contigs                                   |

### C. Custom protein database construction

1. Concatenate **all MAG-derived ORFs** + **unbinned contig ORFs** → FASTA.
2. Append a smaller reference set (e.g., UniProtKB Swiss-Prot) to keep decoy search space manageable.
3. Generate **decoy sequences** (reverse or shuffle) for FDR control.

### D. Metaproteome processing

| Step                               | Recommended engine / comment                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RAW → mzML                         | *msConvert*                                                              |
| Database search                    | *MSFragger+Philosopher* (fast open search handles unknown PTMs)          |
| PSM filtering                      | Percolator at 1 % spectrum-level FDR                                     |
| Protein inference & quantification | *MetaProteomeAnalyzer*, *MSstatsTMT* for isobaric designs ([bioRxiv][2]) |

### E. Linking genes ↔ proteins

*MetaLab 2* or the **Metagenome–Metaproteome (M2P) pipeline** from Zhang et al. 2024 automatically maps PSMs back to contigs, annotates with MAG ID, and produces a gene-level protein-abundance matrix ([Oxford Academic][3]).

### F. Novelty detection pivots

| Granularity           | How to quantify novelty                                                                                                                  | Implementation notes                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protein sequence**  | ▸ BLASTp vs UniRef90 < 50 bit score<br>▸ HHblits probability < 90 %<br>▸ ESM-2 embedding → *Isolation Forest* outlier score ([arXiv][4]) | Combine metrics into a composite z-score; threshold at top 1-2 % most-novel |
| **Structure**         | AlphaFold/ESMFold predicted TM-score < 0.4 vs closest template                                                                           | Use colabfold batch on candidate set                                        |
| **Taxon**             | MAG ANI < 95 % (species), < 90 % (genus)                                                                                                 | Already scored in § B                                                       |
| **Activity evidence** | Spectral count or LFQ intensity > quantile 0.75 in ≥ 2 samples                                                                           | Prioritise truly *expressed* novel ORFs                                     |

*Downstream*: cluster novel proteins with *MMseqs2* to avoid redundancy; annotate motifs with *InterProScan*; rank by spectral intensity × novelty score.

### G. Machine-learning option (if you want an automated flagger)

```text
1. Embed proteins (ESM2-650M) → 128-D PCA  
2. Fit Isolation Forest (contamination=0.01) on reference-annotated proteins  
3. Score all; proteins with score ≥ 0.9 are “novel”  
4. SHAP values on embedding dims highlight which latent features drive novelty
```

This keeps interpretation simple and scales to >1 M sequences.

### H. Experimental & ecological validation

* In-silico: Check pathway gaps (e.g., MetaCyc) to see if novel proteins complete a missing step.
* In-vitro: Clone top-ranked ORFs, test activity (e.g., CAZyme assays) – see Chikere et al. 2025 glycoside-hydrolase workflow ([bioRxiv][5]).
* Ecological modelling: Link abundance of novel proteins with environmental metadata via linear mixed models.

### Key pitfalls to anticipate

* **Database inflation** → FDR rises; keep custom FASTA lean (MAG ORFs only).
* **Spectral undersampling** → Add DIA runs or BoxCar MS to catch low-abundance peptides.
* **Cross-sample comparability** → Use iRT peptides and match-between-runs.
* **False novelty** from truncated ORFs or frame-shifts; screen for length/coverage anomalies.

### Recent case studies for inspiration

* **Zhang et al. 2024 – ISME Communications:** demonstrated paired metagenome–metaproteome workflow to quantify protein activity in microbiome-engineered soils; 17 % of abundant proteins had no KEGG orthologs. ([Oxford Academic][3])
* **Chikere et al. 2025 – bioRxiv:** enrichment + multi-omics unveiled 63 novel glycoside hydrolases with industrial potential. ([bioRxiv][5])
* **Cariani et al. 2025 – Curr Opin Biotech:** review on functional metaproteomics for enzyme discovery. ([ScienceDirect][6])

**Bottom line:** start with a clear novelty definition (sequence, structure, taxon, function), build a MAG-derived protein database to ground your proteomics search, then layer ML-based outlier detection on the integrated gene-protein abundance matrix. This gives you both *statistically defensible* novelty calls and a ranked list of high-value candidates for wet-lab follow-up.
