Below is a **feature-selection + biomarker-(“bookmark”) discovery playbook** that piggybacks on the paired metagenome ↔ metaproteome dataset you already have.  The flow is tuned for a **case–control design with matched samples** but you can mirror the same logic for any paired layout (e.g., pre/post treatment).

## 1  |  Testable hypotheses

| ID                   | Primary claim you’ll try to falsify                                                                                   | Read-out                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **H₁**               | *A compact multi-omic panel (≤ 20 features) predicts case status with AUROC ≥ 0.9.*                                   | Cross-validated AUROC, AUPRC          |
| **H₂**               | *Biomarkers selected by embedded ML methods overlap (> 60 %) with those passing univariate paired tests (FDR < 0.1).* | Jaccard index, hypergeometric p-value |
| **H₃ (exploratory)** | *Novel proteins (no KEGG/UniProt hit) account for ≥ 30 % of the final biomarker panel.*                               | Proportion of “novel” flags in panel  |

Pick **one** hypothesis as your headline (usually H₁), pre-register it, and keep H₂/H₃ as supporting angles.

## 2  |  End-to-end analysis roadmap

### A.  Build tidy feature matrices

1. **Taxa (MAG-level)**: relative abundance → CLR transform.
2. **Proteins (LFQ, grouped by MAG or KO)**: variance-stabilising normalisation (vsn).
3. **Meta-features**: novelty flag (0/1), predicted CAZy family, etc.
4. **Metadata**: subject ID (pairing key), age, sex, batch, etc.

> **Tip:** Store everything in an `.h5ad` or `AnnData` object so each view (taxa, proteins, meta) is a layer—makes multi-omics wrappers like **DIABLO** or **MOFA2** painless.

### B.  Train-test splits that respect pairing

```text
1.  GroupKFold(n_splits = 5, groups = subject_id)
2.  Nested CV:   outer loop for performance, inner loop for
                 hyper-parameter & feature-selection tuning.
```

This prevents information leakage between paired samples.

### C.  Feature-selection stack

| Tier                      | Technique                                                                                                                                   | What it gives you                                                |                                                       |                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Univariate filter** | Paired Wilcoxon / ALDEx2 (compositional); effect size ↔ Cliff’s Δ                                                                           | Fast screen; keeps features with FDR < 0.1 &                     | Δ                                                     | > 0.5                        |
| **2️⃣ Embedded ML**       | ▸ *L1-penalised logistic* (Elastic Net, α ≈ 0.8)<br>▸ *Sparse PLS-DA* (DIABLO) for multi-omics<br>▸ *LightGBM* with **Boruta-SHAP** wrapper | Learns interactions; selects minimal subset that maximises AUROC |                                                       |                              |
| **3️⃣ Stability filter**  | Bootstrapped selection frequency (≥ 70 % across 100 resamples)                                                                              | Makes the panel reproducible                                     |                                                       |                              |
| **4️⃣ Redundancy prune**  | Pearson                                                                                                                                     | ρ                                                                | > 0.8 → keep the feature with higher model SHAP value | Avoids correlated duplicates |

All selection must happen **inside** the inner CV fold; never on the full dataset.

### D.  Model choices & interpretability

| Model                    | Why it works                                       | Interpretation hook                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Elastic Net logistic** | Handles high-p, low-n, gives sparse β              | Non-zero coefficients = biomarker weights  |
| **LightGBM**             | Captures non-linearities, fast                     | *SHAP* for global & local explanations     |
| **sPLS-DA (DIABLO)**     | Designed for coherent multi-omic feature selection | Loading vectors show view-specific markers |

Evaluate with AUROC, AUPRC, Matthews R, and calibration slope (Brier score).

### E.  Biomarker panel finalisation

1. Take intersect of Tier 2 + Tier 3 features.
2. Rank by mean absolute SHAP value across outer folds.
3. Set a **“utility cut-off”**—e.g., keep top 10 markers if AUROC drop ≤ 0.02 when removing the rest.
4. Annotate each feature: taxon ↔ protein ↔ pathway ↔ novelty flag.

Deliverables: JSON manifest + table ready for Luminex / PRM assay design.

### F.  External & wet-lab validation

* **External cohort** (if available): lock the model, test once.
* **Targeted proteomics (PRM/SRM)**: verify abundance of protein biomarkers.
* **qPCR/ddPCR**: validate MAG abundance biomarkers.

---

## 3  |  Common pitfalls & guard-rails

* **Batch confounding**: include batch as a covariate in every model or apply *ComBat* before splits.
* **High dimensionality**: if p/n > 50, always start with univariate trimming (Tier 1).
* **Paired data leakage**: double-check GroupKFold indices—left and right halves of a pair must live in the same fold.
* **Over-optimistic SHAP**: compute SHAP on held-out fold predictions, not on training data.

---

### Bottom line

Use a **nested-CV, multi-tier feature-selection funnel** grounded in compositional statistics and embedded ML.  Tie every result back to the paired study design, enforce stability selection, and you’ll end up with a lean, biologically interpretable biomarker panel that stands up in external data and in the wet lab.
