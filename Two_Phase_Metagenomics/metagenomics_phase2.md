# Cross-Sample Metagenomics Analysis Roadmap

## Phase 2: Data Integration & Preprocessing

### 2.1.1 Multi-Sample Data Harmonization
```text
MAG dereplication across all samples → identify unique species-level clusters
Pan-genome construction → core vs. accessory gene analysis
Abundance matrix standardization → handle technical variation
Metadata integration → clinical, environmental, temporal covariates
Batch effect detection & correction → ComBat, limma methods
```

### 2.1.2 Quality Control Across Samples
```text
Sequencing depth normalization → rarefaction vs. scaling approaches
Sample filtering criteria → minimum reads, assembly quality thresholds
Outlier sample detection → statistical and biological outliers
Missing data handling → imputation strategies for sparse data
```

## Phase 2: Community Structure Analysis

### 2.2.1 Diversity & Dissimilarity Analysis
```text
Alpha diversity trends → Shannon, Simpson, phylogenetic diversity across samples
Beta diversity matrices → Bray-Curtis, weighted/unweighted UniFrac, Aitchison distance
Ordination methods → PCoA, NMDS, t-SNE, UMAP for community visualization
Permutational MANOVA → test for significant community differences between groups
```

### 2.2.2 Community Composition Patterns
```text
Core microbiome identification → taxa present across X% of samples
Variable microbiome analysis → sample-specific vs. condition-specific taxa
Enterotype/cluster analysis → discrete community state identification

```

### 2.2.3 Differential Abundance Analysis
```text
Statistical frameworks → DESeq2, edgeR, ANCOM-BC, MaAsLin2

## Phase 3: Temporal Pattern Detection

### 2.3.1 Longitudinal Diversity Dynamics
```text
Temporal autocorrelation → lag analysis for community persistence
Diversity trajectory modeling → smooth splines, GAMs for trend estimation
Stability metrics → community resilience, resistance, recovery measures
Succession analysis → early vs. late colonizers, climax communities

Lotka-Volterra dynamics → species interaction modeling
Neutral vs. deterministic processes → stochastic community assembly
Regime shift detection → early warning signals, critical transitions
```

## Phase 4: Covariate Effects Analysis

### 2.4.1 Environmental/Clinical Driver Analysis
```text
Constrained ordination → RDA, CCA for environmental gradients
Distance-based RDA → db-RDA for non-linear relationships
Variance partitioning → pure vs. shared effects of covariates
Mantel tests → community-environment correlations
```

### 2.4.2 Machine Learning Approaches
```text
Random Forest regression → covariate importance for community metrics
Gradient boosting → non-linear covariate effects
Neural networks → complex interaction modeling
Feature selection → identify key environmental drivers
```

### 2.4.3 Network Analysis with Covariates
```text
Co-occurrence networks → conditional on environmental variables
Environmental association networks → taxa-environment linkages
Dynamic networks → time-varying interaction patterns
Keystone species identification → network centrality with covariate effects
```

## Phase 5: Cross-Sample Novelty & Pathogen Detection

### 2.5.1 Novel Sequence Tracking
```text
Pan-novelty analysis → novel sequences shared across samples
Sample-specific novelty → unique novel content per sample/condition
Novelty emergence patterns → temporal appearance of novel sequences
Geographic/demographic novelty patterns → spatial distribution analysis
```

### 2.5.2 Pathogen-Focused Analysis
```text
Virulence factor screening → VFDB, virulence gene databases
Antibiotic resistance gene tracking → ARG emergence and spread
Pathogen-associated MAG analysis → potentially pathogenic novel genomes
Toxin/effector prediction → secretion systems, pathogenicity islands
```
